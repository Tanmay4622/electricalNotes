## 2. Sentence Structure

The way a sentence is grammatically constructed, including its parts and their arrangement.

### Subject
The person, place, thing, or idea that is doing or being something.
*   **Example:** ***The dog*** *barked loudly.*

### Predicate
The part of the sentence that contains the verb and tells what the subject does or is.
*   **Example:** *The dog* ***barked loudly.***

### Clause
A group of words that contains a subject and a verb.

#### Independent Clause
A clause that can stand alone as a complete sentence.
*   **Example:** ***She smiled.*** *because she was happy.*

#### Dependent Clause
A clause that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence and must be attached to an independent clause.
*   **Example:** *She smiled* ***because she was happy.***

### Types of Sentences

#### Simple Sentence
Contains one independent clause.
*   **Example:** *The bird sang.*

## 3. Subject-Verb Agreement

The principle that the subject and verb in a sentence must agree in number (singular or plural).

*   **Singular Subject → Singular Verb** (verb often ends in "-s")
*   **Plural Subject → Plural Verb**

### Key Rules

1.  **Subjects Joined by 'and'**: Two or more subjects joined by *and* are plural and take a plural verb.
    *   **Example:** *The **cat and the dog are** playing outside.*

2.  **'Each' and 'Every'**: When a subject is modified by *each* or *every*, it is singular and takes a singular verb.
    *   **Example:** ***Each** student **has** a book.*
    *   **Example:** ***Every** car **needs** fuel.*

3.  **Subjects Joined by 'or'/'nor'**: With two subjects joined by *or* or *nor*, the verb agrees with the subject that is closer to it.
    *   **Example:** *Neither the students nor the **teacher is** happy.*
    *   **Example:** *Neither the teacher nor the **students are** happy.*

4.  **Indefinite Pronouns**: Most indefinite pronouns are singular (e.g., *everyone, anyone, someone, no one, nobody*).
    *   **Example:** ***Everyone wants** to go to the party.*
    *   **Example:** ***Somebody has** to answer the phone.*

5.  **Phrases Between Subject and Verb**: The verb agrees with the subject, not with a noun in a prepositional phrase or other phrase between the subject and verb.
    *   **Example:** *The **box** of chocolates **is** on the table.*
    *   **Example:** *The **woman** with all the dogs **lives** down the street.*

6.  **Some Indefinite Pronouns (SANAM)**: Some indefinite pronouns (*some, any, none, all, most*) can be singular or plural depending on the noun they refer to.
    *   **Example:** ***Some** of the **cake is** gone.* (Cake is singular)
    *   **Example:** ***Some** of the **cookies are** gone.* (Cookies are plural)

7.  **Collective Nouns**: Collective nouns (e.g., *team, family, group, committee*) are usually treated as singular.
    *   **Example:** *The **team is** playing well.*
    *   **Example:** *My **family travels** every year.*

8.  **Nouns That Look Plural**: Some nouns end in "-s" but are considered singular (e.g., *news, economics, mathematics, measles*).
    *   **Example:** *The **news is** on at 6 p.m.*
    *   **Example:** ***Mathematics is** my favorite subject.*

9.  **Units of Measurement**: When a subject represents a unit of time, money, distance, etc., it is treated as singular.
    *   **Example:** *Ten **dollars is** a high price.*
    *   **Example:** *Five **miles is** a long walk.*

10. **'Here' and 'There'**: In sentences starting with *here* or *there*, the true subject follows the verb. The verb must agree with that subject.
    *   **Example:** *Here **is** the **book** you wanted.*
    *   **Example:** *There **are** five **books** on the shelf.*

11. **Subject vs. Predicate Noun**: The verb agrees with the subject of the sentence, not a noun that comes after the verb (a predicate noun).
    *   **Example:** *The biggest **problem is** the many errors.*
    *   **Example:** *The many **errors are** the biggest problem.*

12. **Gerunds as Subjects**: A gerund (an "-ing" word used as a noun) as the subject is singular. Two gerunds joined by *and* are plural.
    *   **Example:** ***Running is** good exercise.*
    *   **Example:** ***Swimming and hiking are** my favorite summer activities.*

13. **Relative Pronouns ('who', 'that', 'which')**: The verb in a relative clause agrees with the noun that the relative pronoun (*who, that, which*) refers to (its antecedent).
    *   **Example:** *She is the **student who writes** the best essays.* (who = student, singular)
    *   **Example:** *She is one of the **students who write** excellent essays.* (who = students, plural)

### Additional & Tricky Cases

1.  **"The number of" vs. "A number of"**:
    *   "The number of" is singular.
        *   **Example:** `**The number of** participants **is** limited.`
    *   "A number of" is plural.
        *   **Example:** `**A number of** people **have** complained.`

2.  **Inverted Sentences**: When the subject comes after the verb, the verb still must agree with the subject.
    *   **Example:** `At the back of the room **sit** the **three quietest students**.`

3.  **Titles and Names**: Titles of works (books, movies, etc.) and names of companies or countries are singular, even if they sound plural.
    *   **Example:** `**The Simpsons is** a famous TV show.`
    *   **Example:** `**The United States has** a large population.`

4.  **Plural-Form Nouns**: Some nouns that look plural are actually singular or are always plural and take a plural verb.
    *   Nouns that are always plural: *scissors, pants, trousers, glasses, tongs*. They take a plural verb.
        *   **Example:** `My **jeans are** in the wash.`
    *   To make them singular, use the phrase "a pair of".
        *   **Example:** `That **pair of scissors is** sharp.`

5.  **Fractions and Percentages**: Like SANAM pronouns, these depend on the object of the preposition `of`.
    *   **Example:** `**Half of the pie is** gone.` (pie is singular)
    *   **Example:** `**Fifty percent of the employees are** on vacation.` (employees are plural)

6.  **"One of those who..."**: This is a common trap. The verb in the relative clause is plural because "who" refers to the plural object of "of".
    *   **Example:** `She is **one of those people who love** to travel.` (The antecedent of 'who' is 'people', not 'one'.)

## 4. Common Grammatical Errors

This section highlights frequent mistakes in English writing and how to correct them.

### 1. Run-On Sentences & Comma Splices

A **run-on sentence** joins two independent clauses without proper punctuation or a conjunction. A **comma splice** is a specific type of run-on where two independent clauses are joined only by a comma.

*   **Error (Run-on):** *I love to write papers I would write one every day if I had the time.*
*   **Error (Comma Splice):** *I love to write papers, I would write one every day if I had the time.*

**Corrections:**
1.  **Use a Period:** *I love to write papers. I would write one every day if I had the time.*
2.  **Use a Semicolon:** *I love to write papers; I would write one every day if I had the time.*
3.  **Use a Conjunction:** *I love to write papers, and I would write one every day if I had the time.*
4.  **Make one clause dependent:** *Because I love to write papers, I would write one every day if I had the time.*

### 2. Sentence Fragments

A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence that is punctuated as if it were a complete sentence. It may lack a subject, a verb, or be a dependent clause standing alone.

*   **Error:** *Because I forgot the exam was today.*
*   **Error:** *Went to the store for groceries.*

**Corrections:**
*   *I forgot my homework **because I forgot the exam was today**.* (Attach the fragment to a complete sentence.)
*   ***I went** to the store for groceries.* (Add the missing subject.)

### 3. Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement Error

A pronoun must agree with its antecedent (the noun it refers to) in number (singular/plural) and gender.

*   **Error:** *Every student should know that **they** need to study.* (The antecedent 'student' is singular, but the pronoun 'they' is plural.)
*   **Correction:** *Every student should know that **he or she** needs to study.*
*   **Correction (restructured):** *All **students** should know that **they** need to study.*

### 4. Misplaced or Dangling Modifiers

A **misplaced modifier** is a word, phrase, or clause that is improperly separated from the word it modifies, making the sentence confusing. A **dangling modifier** modifies a word not stated in the sentence.

*   **Error (Misplaced):** *I saw a dog on the way to the store that was barking loudly.* (Is the store barking?)
*   **Correction:** *On the way to the store, I saw a dog that was barking loudly.*

*   **Error (Dangling):** *Having finished the assignment, the TV was turned on.* (Who finished the assignment?)
*   **Correction:** *Having finished the assignment, **I** turned on the TV.*

### 5. Apostrophe Errors

Apostrophes have two main uses: to show possession and to indicate a contraction. They are not used for plurals.

*   **Error (Plural):** *I bought three **book's**.*
*   **Correction:** *I bought three **books**.*

*   **Error (Possession):** *The **dogs** leash is broken.*
*   **Correction:** *The **dog's** leash is broken.* (One dog)
*   **Correction:** *The **dogs'** leashes are broken.* (Multiple dogs)

*   **Error (Contraction):** *Its a beautiful day.*
*   **Correction:** ***It's** a beautiful day.* (It is)

### 6. Homophone Confusion

Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings.

*   **Their / There / They're**
    *   *They put **their** books over **there** now that **they're** finished.*
*   **Your / You're**
    *   ***You're** going to be late for **your** appointment.*
*   **Its / It's**
    *   *The dog wagged **its** tail because **it's** happy.*

*   **Increase** ↔ **Decrease**

### 3. Homophones

Homophones are words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings and spellings. They are a common source of confusion (as noted in "Common Errors").

*   **to / too / two:** *I am going **to** the store. It is **too** far. I need **two** things.*
*   **see / sea:** *I **see** the **sea** from my window.*

### 4. Homonyms and Homographs

These terms are related and sometimes used interchangeably, but there are distinctions:

*   **Homonyms:** Words that are spelled the same *and* pronounced the same but have different meanings.
    *   **Bat:** a piece of sporting equipment / a flying mammal.
    *   **Address:** to speak to / a location.
    *   **Right:** correct / the opposite of left.

    *   **Desert** (DE-sert): a dry region. / **Desert** (de-SERT): to abandon.

### 5. Analogies

An analogy is a comparison between two things to show how they are alike. Understanding these relationships is a key vocabulary skill.

*   **Type: Part to Whole**
    *   *Wheel is to car as branch is to tree.*
*   **Type: Cause and Effect**
    *   *Thirst is to drink as tired is to sleep.*
*   **Type: Object to Function**
    *   *Pen is to write as shovel is to dig.*
*   **Type: Synonym/Antonym**
    *   *Hot is to warm as cold is to cool.* (Synonym)
    *   *Day is to night as happy is to sad.* (Antonym)
