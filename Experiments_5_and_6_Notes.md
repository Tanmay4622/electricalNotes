# Experiment 5: Ignition Voltage and Power Factor of a Tube Light

## Aim
To measure the ignition voltage and power factor of the given tube light.

## Apparatus Required
*   Tubelight
*   Auto-transformer
*   Wattmeter
*   Ammeter
*   Voltmeter
*   Connecting wires

## Theory
*   **Ignition Voltage:** The minimum voltage required for the ignition or starting up of the tube light.
*   **Real Power:** The actual power consumed by the load resistance. It is measured by a wattmeter.
*   **Apparent Power:** The power lost in the circuit. It is given by VI, where V is the voltage drop and I is the current.
*   **Power Factor (cos φ):** The ratio of real power to apparent power. It can also be expressed as the ratio of the resistance of the circuit to the impedance of the circuit. The value of the power factor lies between 0 and 1, with 1 being the ideal condition.
    *   Power Factor = Real Power (P) / Apparent Power (VI)

## Procedure
1.  Make the connections of the device as shown in the circuit diagram.
2.  Turn on the power supply slowly and carefully increase the supply until the tube light glows (stops fluctuating). Note down this ignition voltage.
3.  Slowly increase the voltage supply and record the values of the voltmeter, ammeter, and wattmeter.

## Observation Table

| Voltage (V) | Current (A) | Power (W) | cos φ (P/VI) |
| :---------- | :---------- | :-------- | :----------- |
| 210 V       | 0.24 A      | 28.19 W   | 0.55         |
| 226 V       | 0.36 A      | 36.26 W   | 0.44         |
| 170 V       | 0.15 A      | 19.39 W   | 0.76         |
| 155 V       | 0.13 A      | 16.41 W   | 0.81         |
| 91 V        | 0.02 A      | 5.13 W    | 0.63         |

## Results
*   **Ignition Voltage of tubelight:** 210V
*   **The power factor (cos φ):** 0.55 + 0.44 + 0.76 + 0.81 + 0.63 / 5 

## Precautions
1.  Zero error in the instrument should be checked.
2.  The connection must be tight.
3.  The supply should not exceed 250V.

# Experiment 6: Polarity Test on a Single Phase Transformer

## Aim
To perform the polarity test on a single-phase transformer.

## Apparatus Required
*   Thick connecting wires
*   Autotransformers
*   Voltmeter of appropriate ranges

## Theory
*   **Polarity:** Polarity means the direction of the induced voltage in the primary and secondary windings of the transformer. If two transformers are connected in parallel, the polarity should be known for the proper connection of the transformer.
*   There are two types of polarities:
    1.  **Additive Polarity:** In this, same terminals of the primary and secondary windings of the transformer are connected.
    2.  **Subtractive Polarity:** In this, the same terminals of the primary and the secondary side of the transformer are connected.
*   When the voltmeter reads the difference (V1 - V2), the transformer is said to be connected with the same polarity.
*   When the voltmeter reads the sum (V1 + V2), the transformer is said to be connected with opposite polarity.

## Circuit Diagram Equations
*   V3 = V1 + V2  → opposite polarity
*   V3 = V1 - V2  → same polarity

## Procedure
1.  Clean the end of connecting wires with sandpaper and make the connection as shown in the diagram.
2.  Once a circuit is set up using a connecting wire, short the transformer coil and note the reading of the voltmeter.
3.  Record the V3 reading and analyze it to be either the difference or sum of V1 & V2 readings, consequently, they are claimed to have the same or opposite polarity respectively.

## Result
Upon conducting the polarity test, the transformer coils are found to have opposite polarity as V3 = V1 + V2.

## Observation Table

| S.No | Voltmeter Reading (V1) | Voltmeter Reading (V2) | Voltmeter Reading (V3) |
| :--- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| 1    | 64                     | 29                     | 93                     |

## Precautions
1.  Don't short circuit the P1-P2 coils or S1-S2 coils of the transformer.
2.  Don't have the circuit setup with the transformer ON for a long time.
3.  Use a voltmeter of appropriate ranges.
4.  Note V1 & V2 reading before short-circuiting.
