# Steven Spielberg's 2016 Harvard Commencement Speech: A Summary and Expansion

This document combines the key points from Steven Spielberg's 2016 Harvard Commencement speech with the full transcript, expanding on the ideas he presented.

## Dropping Out and Returning to College

Spielberg humorously notes that he graduated from college 14 years prior to the speech, having taken 37 years to complete his degree. He dropped out of college in his sophomore year to accept his dream job at Universal Studios. He promised his parents he would re-enroll if his movie career didn't pan out. While his career was successful, he eventually returned to college for his seven children, as he wanted to "walk the walk" when emphasizing the importance of a college education. He earned his degree from Cal State Long Beach in his 50s.

> "I told my parents if my movie career didn't go well, I'd re-enroll. It went all right. But eventually I returned for one big reason. Most people go to college for an education and some go for their parents. But I went for my kids."

## Character-Defining Moments

Spielberg introduces the concept of "character-defining moments," which are prevalent in movies but occur daily in real life. He contrasts the few defining moments in a two-hour film with the continuous string of such moments that make up a person's life. He emphasizes that the choices we make every day shape who we are.

> "What you choose to do next is what we call in the movies the character-defining moment...in real life you face them every day. Life is one strong, long string of character-defining moments."

## The Voices of Others vs. Your Inner Voice

For the first 25 years of our lives, we are conditioned to listen to the voices of others—parents, professors, employers, and mentors. While these voices often provide valuable wisdom, Spielberg cautions against letting them drown out one's own inner voice. He distinguishes between intuition and conscience:

*   **Conscience:** Shouts what you *should* do.
*   **Intuition:** Whispers what you *could* do.

He argues that listening to and following one's intuition is the most character-defining act of all.

> "Listen to that voice that tells you what you could do. Nothing will define your character more than that."

## The Power of Movies as a Mission

Initially, Spielberg's films were largely escapist, reflecting his own values but limited by his own imagination. His perspective shifted after directing *The Color Purple*, a film that opened his eyes to deeper truths and pain. This experience taught him that movies could be more than entertainment; they could be a mission. He encourages the graduates to find their own sense of mission and to confront, rather than avoid, what is painful.

> "While making that film, I realized that a movie could also be a mission. I hope all of you find that sense of mission. Don't turn away from what's painful. Examine it. Challenge it."

## The Importance of History

Spielberg stresses the importance of studying the past to create a better future. He quotes Michael Crichton's professor: "if you didn't know history, you didn't know anything. You were a leaf that didn't know it was part of a tree." He urges the graduates to look beyond the "here and now" of social media and to learn their own family histories to understand who they are.

> "We are a nation of immigrants...this means we all have to tell our own stories. Talk to your parents and your grandparents, if you can, and ask them about their stories. And I promise you, like I have promised my kids, you will not be bored."

## The Role of Parents and Love

Spielberg credits his parents for their support, particularly his father for giving him the movie camera that allowed him to make sense of the world. He also speaks on the importance of friendship and finding love, calling his marriage to Kate Capshaw the "greatest character-defining moment" of his life.

> "I spoke about the importance of intuition and how there's no greater voice to follow. That is, until you meet the love of your life."

## The Need for a Villain: Confronting Hate

Every hero needs a villain, and Spielberg identifies the monsters of our world as racism, homophobia, and various forms of hatred. He speaks of his personal experience with anti-Semitism, and how the belief that it was fading was wrong. This led him to start the Shoah Foundation in 1994, which documents the testimonies of Holocaust survivors and witnesses to other genocides.

> "This world is full of monsters. And there's racism, homophobia, ethnic hatred, class hatred. There's political hatred. And there's religious hatred."

## The Solution: More Humanity and Empathy

Spielberg posits that the only answer to the rising tide of hate, including Islamophobia, is "more humanity." He urges the graduates to replace fear with curiosity and to find the "we" in a world divided into "us and them." This requires empathy that is not just felt but acted upon.

> "The only answer to more hate is more humanity. We gotta repair. We have to replace fear with curiosity...Make it something you act upon. That means vote, peaceably protest, speak up for those who can't, and speak up for those who may be shouting but aren't being heard."

## A Call to Action: Connect with Others

Spielberg concludes with a plea for human connection. He laments that we spend more time looking at our devices than into each other's eyes. He asks everyone in the audience to look into someone's eyes, to feel that moment of shared humanity, and to carry that feeling with them.

> "If you remember nothing else from today, I hope you remember this moment of human connection."

He leaves the graduates with a final wish for justice, peace, and a "true Hollywood-style happy ending."
